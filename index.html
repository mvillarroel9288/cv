          Miranda is the founder and director of Omi, which is a blog that explores
          literature, arts, and culture. She has interned at Cinema Verde which
          focuses on environmental advocacy. At Cinema Verde, she updated their news
          section daily as well as managed their social media platforms. Also, she
          interned at Peaceful Paths and served as an affordable housing advocate for
          domestic abuse survivors. There, she worked directly with survivors and
          helped them with legal matters to find housing. She now combines her passion
          for technology and human rights advocacy to help people gain access to clean
          water, education, food, and other resources all around the world. When
          she is not programming, she can be found writing creatively, reading,
          painting, hiking, doing yoga, meditating, learning a new language, or
          spending time with her cat, Minushka.
